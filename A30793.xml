            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Sermons offer themſelves to the Ears, and perchance find thence ſome further paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to the Heart: But <hi>Prayers</hi> pierce the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens; yea, <hi>Coelos Aereos,</hi> when they are Braſs. <hi>Oratio Juſti;</hi> a good mans <hi>prayer</hi> finds a good and ſpeedy paſſage through thoſe obſtructed paſſages and walls of Braſs, <hi>James</hi> 5.16. <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.23.</p>
            <p>Now here you have not only a Prayer, but a Good mans <hi>prayer,</hi> the <hi>Meekeſt man upon the Earth,</hi> Numb. 12.3. and he a <hi>King</hi> too, but two verſes before the Text: <hi>A King in Jeſurun</hi> that is, amongſt all good and godly men, a King, and ſo eſteemed: or, <hi>Rex apud Rectiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum,</hi> as the Vulgar hath it. God and all Good men acknowledge him for ſuch.</p>
            <p>And ſo you have the Prayer of a <hi>King</hi> for a <hi>King,</hi> or rather for a Race of Kings.

Secondly, The <hi>Prayer</hi> ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized, or thoſe ſpecial Branches: <hi>Firſt,</hi> for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, <hi>Bring him back.

            </p>
            <p>I ſhall handle the Words in their order, and with what brevity I may. <hi>Hear Lord the voyce of Judah.</hi> O, now for ſome <hi>Moſes</hi> who might fully expreſs the drift of <hi>Moſes!</hi> He would tell you, <hi>We are not born for our ſelves alone:</hi> King, Country, Friends every one requires ſome ſpecial duty at our hands. He would tell you, <hi>The Care of Governours doth extend it ſelf in Nondum Natos.</hi> 'Twas a wretched wiſh of his, who with himſelf would have the World diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, that they might periſh together.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Moſes</hi> knowing his day of Diſſolution to approach, prays for a perpetuity of happineſs on his Country; eſpecially on <hi>Judah,</hi> who was to ſway the Scepter. <hi>Hear Lord the voyce of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah.</hi> You may call it <hi>a Legacy, a Prayer,</hi> and <hi>a Prophecy,</hi> for 'tis all theſe; and what is here given, prayed for, and foretold in Earth, was
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49231:7"/> all ratified and confirmed in Heaven. And this Bleſſing is conveyed to <hi>Judah</hi> in a Prayer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Oratio</hi> is <hi>Clavis Gratiarum,</hi> the Key which opens a door to all our happineſs. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt propoſeth a Parable, <hi>that we ſhould always pray,</hi> Luke 18. <hi>Prayers</hi> are <hi>Arma Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianorum,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian.</hi> And I fear thoſe wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons have been too often wanting in our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. I am ſure they were <hi>the weapons,</hi> the beſt weapons in <hi>Moſes</hi> days. And you may ſee what made <hi>Joſhua</hi> conquer <hi>Amalek;</hi> and what put life into the Camp, whiles <hi>Moſes, Cruce</hi> and <hi>Prece,</hi> prevails with God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.11, 12. And the Apoſtle doth perchance allude to this, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. when he requires men to pray, <hi>Lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up pure hands every where:</hi> much more when we expoſe our lives to the Caſualties of War. <hi>When the Hoſte goeth forth againſt thine Enemies, then keep thee from every wicked thing, Deut.</hi> 23.9. then eſpecially, <hi>then</hi> or never. <hi>When</hi> Judah <hi>is in Captivity, or danger, then pour out thy ſoul in Prayer to God;</hi> and <hi>then</hi> eſpecially, <hi>then</hi> or never.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Audi Domine;</hi> the <hi>ſecond</hi> thing obſervable; To whom <hi>Moſes</hi> doth direct his Prayer; <hi>Hear Lord;</hi> not hear <hi>Abraham,</hi> hear <hi>Iſaak;</hi> or if thoſe Patriarchs were then in <hi>Limbo,</hi> as our Neighbours tell us, yet methinks they ſhould have another conceit of <hi>Enoch,</hi> whom God took away, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. nay tranſlated him, that he ſhould not ſee death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.5.

            <p>Methinks I hear a voyce, like that of the Viſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.9. <hi>Trajice in Macedoniam: Come over,</hi> Come over into your own Country, and to your own People, <hi>and help us.</hi> Theſe

            <p>The Third part followeth: <hi>Let his hands be ſufficient for him.</hi> What is meant by <hi>Hands</hi> in Scripture you well know, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. <hi>They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred not his</hi> Hand, <hi>nor the day when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered them from the Enemy.</hi> Pſal. 80. <hi>Let thy Hand be upon the man of thy right Hand.</hi> Pſal. 144. <hi>Send thine Hands from above: rid me and deliver me out of the great waters, from the Hand of ſtrange Children.</hi> The <hi>Hand</hi> being the Inſtrument of Power and Execution. Hence ſay we, that, <hi>Milites ſunt Manus Imperatoris: The Souldiers are the Generals Hands.</hi> And <hi>Manus Militum</hi> are a Band of Men. So then, <hi>Let his hands be ſufficient for him: Let him have Force ſufficient of his own, to defend his Right, and beat down his Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To implore <hi>Forraign Forces</hi> hath ever been uſual, and yet more uſual than ſafe: But, <hi>Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitas cogit ad triſtia.

A <hi>Word miſtaken</hi> hath rent the Victory out of the Conquerours hands. You know what was ſaid of <hi>Siſera,</hi> Judges 5. <hi>The Stars fought againſt Siſera.</hi> And King <hi>Philip</hi> ſaid as much of his <hi>Armado</hi> in 88.</p>
            <p>But Seven years before that, an Army of <hi>Mice</hi> deſtroyed a whole Country. <hi>Mice</hi> were too hard for the <hi>Philiſtins. Lice</hi> for the <hi>Aegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptians.</hi> And <hi>Frogs</hi> forced the <hi>Abderites</hi> (a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Thrace</hi>) to leave their Country. In a word, No <hi>Creature,</hi> but, if God ſay the word, will plead our Cauſe, and fight our Quarrel againſt the Mighty.</p>
            <p>And therefore the Fourth part makes all Cock-ſure. <hi>And be thou his help againſt his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.</hi> Mark: <hi>Our Hands,</hi> and then <hi>Gods help.</hi> Not, <hi>Lord, help,</hi> and no more. That's a good word, but it muſt not be miſplaced. Firſt, Do we our parts; and then <hi>Succurre Domine.</hi> Thus <hi>David</hi> undertakes the Quarrel againſt <hi>Goliah, Armatus non tam ferro quam fide,</hi> as St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> ſaid: Takes his Sling, but truſts in God. <hi>Qui confidit in Homine, Confidit in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbra tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeunte,</hi> ſaith the ſame Father. That Rule is General, <hi>Without me ye can do nothing:</hi> Our Saviours words, <hi>John</hi> 18. <hi>Except the Lord keep the City,</hi> Pſal. 127. <hi>Except the Lord go out with
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49231:13"/> our Armies,</hi> Pſal. 60. which if He do, how eaſily ſhall <hi>Gideon</hi> prevail againſt the <hi>Midianites?</hi> and with an handful of Men overcome a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Army? He breaks the Counſel of <hi>Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel.</hi> He frees <hi>Samaria</hi> from the <hi>Syrians.</hi> He makes <hi>Senacheribs</hi> huge Army an heap of Corpſes. And that knew well the firſt King of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> Pſal. 44.6. <hi>In nomine tuo conculcabimus:</hi> Not my <hi>Bow,</hi> not my <hi>Sword; But in thy Name ſhall we tread down thoſe that riſe up againſt us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Twas the ſaying of a Mad-man in <hi>Sophocles (Aiax) Let Cowards cry to the Heavens for help, we could overcome without a Deity.</hi> And you have read of <hi>Timotheus,</hi> that noble <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Captain, who in all his Enterprizes did ſtill return Conquerour, till puffed up with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Victories, he looked on himſelf as more than a Man, and cried out, <hi>Hoc ego feci, non fortuna;</hi> but he never won Battle afterwards. God will no longer help, than he is magnified for his help. And therefore, <hi>God be Judahs help a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Enemies.</hi> Nor is this the leaſt of Gods Titles to be <hi>an Helper:</hi> An helper in Need. An helper in Adverſity. An helper of the Poor, and Fatherleſs. <hi>Adjutor meus,</hi> faith the King of <hi>Judah</hi> of the God of <hi>Judah.</hi> When formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Monſters ſought after his ſoul, <hi>The Lord is my Helper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>GOD worketh all in all,</hi> and yet is God ſaid to be <hi>our Helper only;</hi> That we ſhould (as I ſaid) uſe our beſt Means; and yet, in our greateſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, <hi>Lift up our eyes to the hills, from whence commeth our Help.</hi> Do our beſt, but truſt in God.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49231:14"/> When all other helps fail, then is God our Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. <hi>The Lord ſaw the Afflictions of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>that they were very bitter, For there was not any ſhut up, nor any left, nor any helper for</hi> Judah, <hi>then he ſaved them by the hand of</hi> Jeroboam, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 14.26. <hi>Look on us,</hi> ſay thoſe two Diſciples, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. yet were they but the <hi>Inſtruments</hi> only, and they confeſs it, <hi>v.</hi> 12. Look on him who is both able, and willing to <hi>help</hi> all thoſe that faithfully call upon him. Then may we ſay with <hi>David,</hi> with <hi>Paul,</hi> and that with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.6. <hi>The Lord is my Helper, I will not fear what Man can do unto me.</hi> 'Tis taken out of 118. <hi>Pſal. v.</hi> 6. And 'tis remarkable, at the 10. <hi>v. All Nations compaſſed me about; Philiſtines, Syrians, Ammonites, Moabites, Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites;</hi> and yet 'tis but, <hi>Quid mihi faciat homo?</hi> a Man, nay one Man. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. <hi>A thouſand Years are,</hi> with GOD, <hi>but as one day;</hi> and a thouſand Armies as one man. So for St. <hi>Paul:</hi> He was <hi>oppreſſed by men; fought with Beaſts,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. <hi>wreſtled with Devils,</hi> Eph. 6.12. yet ſtill 'tis but <hi>Quid mihi faciat homo?</hi> All theſe are but one man, in compariſon of him that made Man. And therefore, I ſpeak confidently, ſaith St. <hi>Paul, I will not fear what Man can do unto me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is <hi>Judahs</hi> Caſe. Let his Enemies be never ſo many, never ſo mighty, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious: yet if <hi>GOD</hi> be his Helper, he need not <hi>fear what Man can do unto him.</hi> Nay, let them be worſe than men (if ought can be worſe,) for <hi>Homo homini lupus;</hi> Let them be the worſt of Beaſts, unreaſonable, indomitable, and perverſly
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49231:14"/> violent; yet <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> was not the firſt that ſlew a Lion, <hi>David</hi> will tell you ſo, and others after him: <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.33. <hi>Men, Beaſts,</hi> and All will come under, if <hi>GOD</hi> be our <hi>helper</hi> againſt thoſe Enemies. Let them be <hi>Devils</hi> too, if they be, yet with <hi>Devils</hi> muſt the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> man encounter. <hi>Et hoc genus Daemoniorum:</hi> Let them be the <hi>worſt of Devils,</hi> Matth. 17.21. yet nought but <hi>Incredulity</hi> can retard our Victory over thoſe moſt malicious and incarnate Devils.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Si Deus nobiſcum:</hi> Rom. 8.31. <hi>If God be for us, who can be againſt us?</hi> O therefore, <hi>Hear, Lord, the voyce of</hi> Judah, <hi>be thou his help againſt his Enemies.</hi> All the Bleſſings which <hi>Jacob</hi> the Father bequeathed to this Son, <hi>Gen</hi> 49. All thoſe Bleſſings light upon our <hi>Judah. Let his hands be in the neck of his Enemies,</hi> verſe 8. <hi>Let him be a Lion whom none durſt rouz up,</hi> v. 9. <hi>Let the Scepter never depart from him, till</hi> Shiloh <hi>come again,</hi> v. 10. <hi>All peace and plenty be to him and his,</hi> v. 11.12.</p>
            <p>And that I may conclude with <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Words, with <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Prayer: <hi>Hear Lord the voyce of</hi> Judah: His Prayers, and our Prayers. Let our Cries find entrance to the Throne of Grace. <hi>Bring him back unto his People.</hi> And they that will not be his People, O, let them not be a People at all: Cut them off from the face of the Earth. <hi>Bring him back unto his People;</hi> that People who with us have born the burthen and heat of the Day: Who cut of holes and Priſons peep out for a Redeemer and a Deliverer. Who pray for <hi>Judah,</hi> and will fight for <hi>Judah:</hi> To this People bring him

               <hi>I know, Brethren, that through Ignorance ye did it, as did alſo your Rulers.</hi> Where you have, Firſt, A Compellation, or Title which St. <hi>Peter</hi> gives thoſe <hi>Jews, Brethren.</hi> Secondly, The Sin that he laies to their charge, <hi>Feciſtis iſta, iſta praedicta;</hi> Betraying, Denying, Killing the <hi>Lord of Life.</hi> Thirdly, A mitigation or extenuation of the Sin, <hi>You did it of Ignorance.</hi> Fourthly, The extenſion of the Extenuation; to the <hi>Rulers</hi> as well as to the Inferiour ſort: <hi>You and your Rulers did it through Ignorance.</hi> There are two other little words in the Text, <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>I begin with the Compellation, <hi>Brethren.</hi> I remember the Counſel a Monk of <hi>Bangor</hi> gave his Fellows, who were to appear before <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> another Monk ſent from <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great. <hi>Hereby,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>you ſhall know whether he be a Good man, and ſent from God, If he be Affable?

Affability</hi> and <hi>Gentleneſs</hi> get ground upon men, and creep into their Affections. <hi>A ſoft tongue breaketh the bones,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 25.15.

            <p>Let us ſee then, Firſt of <hi>Ignorance,</hi> what it is.

A finite Nature cannot have an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite power, and therefore of neceſſity muſt be <hi>ignorant</hi> in many things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ignorance</hi> is <hi>the privation of Knowledge,</hi> and 'tis two-fold; <hi>Lawful,</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawfull:</hi> Of thoſe things which we may know; and of thoſe things which we are bound to know.</p>
            <p>We may know many things which we are not bound to know, but may be ignorant of them without ſin. <hi>Ariſtodemus</hi> the Philoſopher, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed many years in ſearching out the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>Bee,</hi> which yet he could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs; ſo <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> Another in <hi>Tertulllian, Sexcentos execuit, ut Naturam hominis inveniret, Anatomized ſix hundred men, to find the Nature of Man,</hi> and he came ſhort of his deſire.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49231:20"/> 
               <hi>Ignorance;</hi> The one they call <hi>Simple</hi> the other <hi>Groſs,</hi> or <hi>Affected.</hi> The firſt, <hi>Quo ſimplicior eò tutior; The more ſimple, the more pardonable.</hi> Of this St. <hi>Auguſtine, Temeritas poenam habet, Ignorantia promeretur veniam: Reſolved, raſh, wilful undertakers muſt expect a plague, when honeſt</hi> Ignorance <hi>will find favour.</hi> And this I take to be St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Caſe; <hi>A Blaſphemer, a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor, and Injurious;</hi> but all through <hi>Ignorance,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. <hi>And therefore,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I obtained Mercy.</hi> And being better informed, you have him by and by a Better man; and <hi>no way diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to the Heavenly Viſion.</hi> There is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which they call <hi>groſs</hi> or <hi>affected Ignorance:</hi> When he that is <hi>ignorant, will be ignorant ſtill.</hi> He doth quench the <hi>motions of the Spirit;</hi> Slights the dictates of his own <hi>Conſcience;</hi> Neglects to enquire, or uſe the <hi>means</hi> whereby he may be better informed. Thus the <hi>Sadduces: They did erre, not knowing the Scriptures,</hi> Matth. 22.29. They would not know them: But as the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi> ſaith of ſuch like; <hi>They know not neither will they underſtand, but walk on ſtill in darkneſs,</hi> Pſal. 82.

            <p>Now, which of theſe was the <hi>Jews Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance?</hi> Our Saviour tells us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.14, 15. <hi>The Heart of this people is waxed groſs, and their Ears are dull of hearing, and their Eyes have they cloſed; leaſt they ſhould ſee with their Eyes, and hear with their Ears, and underſtand with their Heart, and ſhould be converted, and I ſhould heal them.</hi>

            <p>See we then in the next place, how far this <hi>Ignorance</hi> will excuſe. Chriſt ſaith in the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of St. <hi>John, Non haberent peccatum: If I had not come and ſpoken unto them, they had not had ſin: Not that ſin of Incredulity,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Augustine.

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49231:22"/> ſhut up this Point in theſe five Concluſions.

Secondly, All Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, I ſpeak of that we are bound to know, is dangerous; being both a ſin, and a puniſhment for ſin. Thirdly, This ſin is <hi>ferax,</hi> fruitful, and the mother of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſins. <hi>Affectata inficit, Neglecta interficit.</hi> Fourthly, Groſs and Affected Ignorance is no unpardonable ſin, and therefore is in it ſelf no ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt. Laſt of all, If Ignorance make a man ſo capable of mercy (yet underſtand it for ſins committed through Ignorance) and what is this to all other our audacious ſins, malicious ſins, and ſuch as we wilfully plunge our ſelves into, and oft-times with much reluctancy of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: Be not merciful to them, <hi>Qui ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantur Iniquitatem, Pſal.</hi> 59.5.

Chriſtian diſcretion moves in a lower Orb: And I ſhall only call you to what your Eyes behold, <hi>Mark the perfect.</hi> I, and here I ſhall be deceived too, if I expect to find a man without ſpot or wrinkle; every way abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute. <hi>If we ſay we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. <hi>Nemo qui non peccet; All ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.36.

            <q>Integer eſt omnis qui integer eſſe cupit.</q>
            <p>And therefore mark ſuch an one, ſuch an one whom no fear or favour, no by-reſpects can draw away from doing his duty to God and Man. <hi>Ita ero integer à Superbiis ne Dominentur mihi.

'Tis ſaid of many Kings in the Old Teſtament, <hi>That they did many brave things:</hi> But there came in a <hi>But</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that ſpoiled all: <hi>But the High Places were not taken away:</hi> But the Calves in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi> ſtood ſtill: <hi>But he departed not from the ſins of</hi> Jeroboam, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Still one But or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did marr all.</p>

            <p>But he that will be himſelf, and play the man, that holds out in Conſtancy and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, that endeavours to grow up in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Religion, that will not ſell his Birth-right for a Meſs of Pottage, nor ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifie
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49231:29"/> his Brains with Pot and Pipe, nor ſpend his purer Spirits in the boſome of Harlots; nor give himſelf up to the Cares of this Life, and thoughts of Ambition: That hath learnt (with the Apoſtle) <hi>in what ſtate ſoever he is to be content.</hi> This is <hi>Homo quantumvis pretii,</hi> A man well worth the noting: Mark ſuch an one. This were a work beſeeming a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller, and not feed their eyes, and fraught their diſcourſe with <hi>Coriats</hi> Gallows: The Tun of <hi>Heidelberg:</hi> The <hi>Venetian</hi> Curtiſans: The Stews at <hi>Rome:</hi> or that Charitable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion made for Baſtards: And yet are theſe the chiefeſt Obſervations of many a frothy Traveller, bringing home little elſe unleſs it be a rotten Carcaſs, corrupt Manners, a wounded Conſcience, or ſome Fantaſtick faſhion of Attire.</p>
            <p>But wiſer men have wiſer thoughts; They'l <hi>mark the perfect man:</hi> Yea, and with <hi>Herod,</hi> they will obſerve him too: <hi>Mark</hi> 6.20. Highly honour him for his Goodneſs ſake, 1 <hi>Theſs.</hi> 5.13.</p>
            <p>And thus the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> leads us to our ſecond part: <hi>And behold the upright.</hi> He was a <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> man, and <hi>Herod</hi> knew it, but that's not all, He was <hi>Rectus, An upright man too:</hi> And he did ſmart for it. And he might have ſlept in a whole skin, as we ſay; If he could not flatter, yet he could hold his peace: He might have choſen whether he would have come in with his <hi>Non licet.</hi> And he that takes upon him to reprove great Men, muſt expect no great thanks afterward. 'Tis true indeed;
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49231:29"/> But how ſhould he be a good man then? how ſhould he be upright?</p>
            <p>The man you are to mark, muſt be, <hi>Bonus ſibi, aliis benevolus:</hi> Good to himſelf, Good to other, Juſt to both There's a double Uprightneſs or Juſtice; Of the Perſon, and of the Cauſe. We would have both: And yet may a Wicked man have a good Cauſe, and a Good man have a bad Cauſe, or a good Cauſe badly proſecuted or acted. But I ſhall leave this. The <hi>uprightneſs</hi> in my Text is in relation to others; <hi>To render to every man his due, Rom.</hi> 13. Firſt, to God: Secondly, to <hi>Caeſar:</hi> Thirdly, to our Fellow Subjects.

            <p>I fear me there are not many of thoſe black Swans in thoſe blacker dayes; when the world is ſo full of Oppreſſion, Circumvention, and Fraud: <hi>Frater fratrem</hi> (a token the world draws near to an end) one brother cuts the throat of another; one friend ſupplants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: <hi>Nulla fides pietàſque viris qui caſtra ſequuntur;</hi> that was the old ſaying. But Court and Camp and all is alike; yea, and <hi>Honeſtiſſima nomina rebus turpiſſimis imponunt,</hi> as the Oratour ſaid. Cheating, Lying, Whoring, Painting, are entertained under the cloak of Wit, Policy, Kindneſs, Care. <hi>Honeſty</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> are dull Ceremonies: unleſs with <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> we can wear all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and change our <hi>Religion</hi> as we do our <hi>Garments;</hi> or unleſs wee'l ſpeak <hi>placentia,</hi> run with the Times, and court the Ears of our itching Auditors, our Company may well be ſpared.

            <p>In the ninth of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> you have one twelve years diſeaſed; at length a Phyſician was found who could, and did cure. In the fifth of <hi>John</hi> one lies impotent thirty eight
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:49231:32"/> years at the Pool <hi>Betheſda,</hi> at length comes one, who with a <hi>Surge</hi> makes him ſound. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother blind from his Nativity, with an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie remedy came ſeeing, <hi>John</hi> 9. So (as I ſaid) the <hi>good man</hi> meets with many difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the courſe of his life: But <hi>Finis pax;</hi> All's well at laſt, his end is happy. I ſee <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> driven from place to place, at one time ready to ſtarve; another time his wife in jeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardy to looſe her honour; croſſed in his Children; unhappy in his Friends, Kinred, every way; and yet his Boſome now a recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle for the Saints of God. As much might I ſay of <hi>Moſes, Elias,</hi> and many others: Yea, <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, whoſe head was ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten from his Body, yet was not that his laſt end; But that which was ſaid of him, <hi>Multi in ejus Nativitate gaudebunt,</hi> afterwards came to paſs; the day of his Birth was made ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred to all Poſterity, and was ſolemnized by the very Heathen themſelves in St. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nards</hi> dayes.</p>
            <p>Take heed therefore what Concluſions you draw from the preſent condition or ſucceſs of things. Thus did <hi>Shimei</hi> deal by <hi>David, Nunc ad calculos redactus eſt; Come out thou bloudy man, thou man of Belial;</hi> now thou pay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <pb n="55" facs="tcp:49231:32"/>
            <p>Thus do our Adverſaries, who, puffed up with their ſucceſs, and our misfortunes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude thence (as the <hi>Turk</hi> may do as much) the goodneſs of their Cauſe. But ſtay, our laſt end is not yet come; no, nor theirs nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Ante obitum nemo, &amp;c.</hi> You know what <hi>Solon</hi> ſaid: And though I undertake not to Devine, yet I dare ſay with him, <hi>Num.</hi> 16.29. <hi>If theſe men die the common death of all men, then the Lord hath not ſent me.</hi> However, there's an <hi>end,</hi> and a <hi>laſt end;</hi> and that <hi>Balaam</hi> ſaw, when he would have his <hi>laſt end like the Iſraelites, Numb.</hi> 23.

            <p>'Tis <hi>bonum deſiderabile,</hi> as ſhe ſaid of the Tree, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. O thoſe bleſſed dayes, when men might ſit down under their own Vine and Fig tree, and might eat the labours of their own hands: When they were not awaked with the Drum and Trumpet, nor terrified with the claſhing of Armour, and the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of Souldiers; <hi>Veteres migrate Coloni</hi> was not heard in our Streets: But <hi>the Mountains</hi> did <hi>bring peace, Pſal.</hi> 72. The barren Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain requited the coſt beſtowed on them plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully: A bleſſed peace: and this by Gods grace we ſhall have in the end. And yet, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Behold a better, <hi>Pax Corporis,</hi> The peace of the Body. <hi>Abraham</hi> was much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted for want of Children, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. <hi>Ahab</hi> for his Neighbours Vineyard. <hi>Haman</hi> at the very ſight of <hi>Mordecai, Hoſter</hi> 5. So much troubled, that neither his Riches, Children, nor Honour, nought could do him good, as long as he ſaw <hi>Mordecai</hi> the Jew ſitting at the Kings Gate: And if he had his purpoſe in this too, yet what would all avail him, if he could not have his health? The gouty Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal would give his Cardinals Cap a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times, that he might be freed of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe. Let him ſpeak who hath the Stone or Strangury, nay be it but the Tooth-ach, his courage, ſtrength, appetite, all is gone.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49231:33"/> The Valetudinary man is like St. <hi>Pauls</hi> wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, <hi>Vivens mortua,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.6. as good as dead, while he is alive. So that <hi>Pax corporis,</hi> the health of the body is no ſmall bleſſing: and God hath bleſſed the moſt of us with this. And yet is not this <hi>Pax illa.</hi> Thirdly, there is another and a better peace, <hi>The Peace of Conſcience:</hi> and this may he have, who with <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſits at <hi>Dives</hi> gate, or with diſtreſſed <hi>Job</hi> lies ſtinking on a Dung-hill: He fears not, though <hi>the Earth be moved, and the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains carried into the middeſt of the Sea.</hi> This <hi>Peace</hi> had the <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Martyrs</hi> in the height of their Torments. <hi>Now begin I to be Corn for my Saviour,</hi> ſaith one: And <hi>verte aliud la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> ſaith another, roſting on the Gridiron. There was <hi>Juſtitia cauſae, &amp; juſtitia perſonae</hi> both; the Cauſe was good; the Sufferers <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>upright,</hi> and therefore all went well, whiles the Mind and Conſcience was at peace. This made <hi>David</hi> ſay, <hi>I will lay me down in peace, and ſleep;</hi> yea, even then when his Enemies compaſſed him round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. Whereas <hi>the wicked are like the troubled Sea that cannot reſt, and there is no peace to the wicked, ſaith my God,</hi> Iſa. 57. the laſt verſe. Sure if we would look upon the ends of many of our Incendiaries and bloody Traitors, ſlain, ſhot, hanged, or otherwayes cut off, we might ſee with what fears and terrours of Conſcience they took their parting. Their Souls were required of them, as 'twas ſaid of his, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. God knows, much againſt their wills.</p>
            <pb n="58" facs="tcp:49231:34"/>
            <p>But for ours, with what undaunted Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage did they tread the Scaffold, and look grim Death in the face? with St. <hi>Stephen, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dormierunt,</hi> they <hi>fell aſleep:</hi> And with <hi>Simeon,</hi> They did <hi>depart in peace,</hi> So then, look upon both; look upon the <hi>end</hi> of both: And <hi>finis hujus hominis pax;</hi> their Life good, their Cauſe good, and the <hi>End</hi> of them was <hi>peace.</hi> Their Enemies might do their worſt, but <hi>Animae non habent quod faciant,</hi> as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaid of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced Prophet, ſlain by a Lion.

            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Pax illa vera, &amp; Hereditas Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianorum,</hi> as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaid.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49231:37"/> alone, <hi>Hold thy hand.</hi> He lengthens the day to <hi>Joſhuah:</hi> Quencheth the violence of the Fire to the three Children: Stops the mouth of the Lions for <hi>Daniel:</hi> Addeth fifteen years to <hi>Hezekiah:</hi> Wealth, Children, all to <hi>Job. Whom have I in Heaven but thee? And there is none on earth in compariſon of thee.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Deſiſte à me; Good Lord ſpare me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, as God doth puniſh, ſo doth he puniſh even Kings themſelves. <hi>No</hi> partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or <hi>reſpect of perſons with the higheſt. David, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nctus Domini: Servus Domini:</hi> He, whom the mouth of God pronounceth <hi>upright, ſave in the matter of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 15.5. Yet he ſmarts under the Rod. Kings are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted for their Eminency, nor diſpenced with for their Potency. <hi>Reges in ipſos Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium eſt Jovis:</hi> Great they are, and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a Greater. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> may cry out, <hi>Who is the Lord that I ſhould fear him? Caligula</hi> may tell his Grandmother, <hi>All things are lawful for him, who doth rule and command all:</hi> And wicked <hi>Julia</hi> may buzz into the Ears of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racalla, That he's above the reach of Laws.</hi> But he that ſits in Heaven <hi>doth laugh them all to ſcorn:</hi> He calls the Chiefeſt, the Greateſt as <hi>Stewards</hi> to account. And in much rigour and ſeverity are they oft-times puniſhed.</p>
            <p>You that know the miſeries of Flight, and what 'tis to be made Exiles; you will ſay ſo; when you ſhall ſee a King fly from his Royal City, and with his handful of men, all weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſeek for ſhelter in the Wilderneſs. You that know the ſacred tye of Friendſhip, and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49231:38"/> what 'tis to be betrayed by your neareſt and deareſt Friends; you will ſay ſo: when you ſhall ſee a man, a good man injured, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by thoſe he loved beſt, and did moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem. You that have Children, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by know (what none elſe can) the love that Parents bear unto their Children; you will ſay ſo: when you ſhall ſee a Father robbed, and deſpoiled, and deprived of his Children by his Children. <hi>Joſeph is not, and Simeon is not, and will ye take Benjamin away alſo? Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar is defloured; Amnon is ſlain; Abſolon, O my ſon Abſolon; Abſolon</hi> come to a fearful and prodigious end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O Lord, ſpare me.</hi> Surely <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaid much in few words, <hi>Bonun incogritum carere liberis:</hi> An unknown, and unimaginable good to have no Children. Well, whether 'twere this, or whatſoever elſe beſides this, 'twas <hi>Plaga,</hi> a Plague; and a ſharp one too, that made him cry out, <hi>He was even conſumed by the means of Gods heavy hand.</hi> But that will read a leſſon to Rulers, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. <hi>He that ruleth over men muſt be juſt, ruling in the fear of God:</hi> If he do otherwiſe, he muſt expect a blow. He may riſe with the Sun, but his day will not be without Clouds. As ſecure as many a Great Man thinks himſelf; God keeps his Circuit, Viſitation, puniſhing their Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with the Rod, and their Iniquities with Scourges.</p>
            <p>But, fourthly, here's a ſpecial and reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Caſe; <hi>Spare me:</hi> Nay, <hi>Tu deſiſte, Do thou ſpare me,</hi> who only haſt power to puniſh me.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49231:38"/> None but the <hi>King of Kings</hi> may puniſh or take account of Kings: <hi>Tibi peccavi, Tibi ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li, Pſal.</hi> 51.4. <hi>David</hi> had ſinned againſt men too, by private injuries, by publick wrongs, by general ſcandal: Ask poor <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> and <hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi> and the thouſands of Widows and Fatherleſs, 2 <hi>Samuel,</hi> the laſt Verſe. Yet <hi>Tibi,</hi> and <hi>Tibi ſoli.</hi> As a King he was exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the puniſhment of men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The leſſer are bleſſed of the greater, Heb.</hi> 7.7. So the leſſer puniſhed by the greater: And as <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. <hi>There is none greater in the houſe than I.</hi> None is greater in the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom than the King. A Deo Secundus: Solo Deo minor:</hi> That the Doctrine and Belief of the Primitive times.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, well now, What ſhall we poor ſouls ſay? Our Fathers had the happineſs to ſee better dayes, and were carried to their Graves in peace, and had that unſpeakable bleſſing, to have their Children bury them, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> had, <hi>Gen.</hi> 35. the laſt Verſe. Our miſeries increaſe at home and abroad; and what their end, or when their end, who can tell? But yet <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> have drunk, we ſee, of the ſame cup before us; <hi>Are we better than they?</hi> O Lord, I know the way of man is not in himſelf; It is not in man that walketh to direct his ſteps. <hi>O Lord, correct us;</hi> but, <hi>ad modum,</hi> with meaſure, not with rigour, as <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſaid, Chap. 10. at the end, <hi>Pour out thy fury upon the Heathen that have not known thee, and upon the Families that call not upon thy Name: For they have eaten up</hi> Jacob,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49231:39"/> and devoured him, and conſumed him, and have made his Habitation deſolate. <hi>Let us not fall into the hands of men,</hi> wretched, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and malicious men.</p>
            <p>And thus are we come to our firſt Stop or Pauſe; <hi>O ſpare me:</hi> And <hi>ſpare me that I may recover ſtrength</hi> That of the Poet is known; and it hath ſometimes ſtaggered the beſt of men:

            <p>
               <hi>Pompey,</hi> after the <hi>Pharſalian</hi> Battel, diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with <hi>Cratippus</hi> of his overthrow, did thence conclude againſt all Providence: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi> (ſaith he.) <hi>his Cauſe was good, and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs naught. But we have not thus learned God</hi> (however he ſometimes ſuffer us to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.) <hi>And we aſſure our ſelves he will deliver and refreſh us:</hi> But as God told <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bram,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49231:39"/> when the Iniquities of the Amorites is full,</hi> and our ſins fewer. And that day, we hope that day is coming.</p>

But he cannot periſh that cannot deſpair: He cannot deſpair that ſees a Door of Comfort open in the midſt of Sorrows. No man brought ſo low but he may riſe again. <hi>I am conſumed,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>quite conſumed,</hi> verſe 10. Yet no Diſeaſe but may find a Phyſician a Cure. Ask that Woman in the Fifth of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> that had an Iſſue of Blood twelve Years, <hi>and had ſuffered many things of many Phyſicians, and had ſpent all that ſhe had;</hi> and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worſe and worſe.

            </p>
            <p>And is't not poſſible? Why may we not live to ſee our <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> after their ſo general a Rebellion, do the like?

            </p>
            <p>'Tis too true; The beſt of men cannot ſo curb and conquer their Affections at all times but that ſometimes their Paſſions will find vent; And poor <hi>Clay</hi> dares adventure to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulate with the <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49231:41"/> under the burden of our Afflictions, and grow deſperate: Neither to rely upon our own Abilities, and become inſolent: But to make our addreſs to him, who only can cure and comfort us. And this was <hi>Job's</hi> Caſe, <hi>Job</hi> 10.20, 21. <hi>Are not my dayes few?</hi> Ceaſe then and let me alone, that I may take comfort a little, before I go whence I ſhall not return; even to the Land of darkneſs, and ſhadow of death.</p>
            <p>And here make we our ſecond Stop and Pauſe; <hi>That I may recover my ſtrength.</hi> The third comes in, <hi>Before I go hence:</hi> Recover, and recover ſpeedily: <hi>Before I go hence; Mors Medicus,</hi> a ſure Phyſician; he cures all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes; all bodily ones. But here's one ſeeks a ſalve before he go hence; for hence he muſt. The Walls of Purgatory were not built in thoſe dayes. He muſt recover <hi>before</hi> he <hi>go hence,</hi> or not at all. He was a King and a rich King too. He might have had Prayers enough, and Doles enough after his <hi>Obit</hi> and <hi>Interrment;</hi> but he dares not venture on that Cure. And though he knew a <hi>locum refrigerii</hi> after this life, yet he ſees, and ſhews us out the way thither by a recovery here, <hi>before</hi> he <hi>go hence,</hi> to get remiſſion, and refreſhment afterwards. Recover here to do well afterward. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment which he here craves, is from the pain and trouble which he ſuffered for his ſins. Yet this good do his troubles work upon him, They withdraw his mind from the Vanities of this World; make him meditate upon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I thought the World had been mine eternally. But now in his Affliction, he is better informed; and he that thought he ſhould live for ever, doth tell you of his going hence. The Wiſe mans counſel is, <hi>Memorare noviſſima:</hi> the thinking upon Death is the ready way to Life. And here's one takes that courſe, meditating on another World, before he be compelled to leave this. Many caſt of theſe thoughts as too dull, ſad, and melancholly. <hi>None ſo old,</hi> as the Oratour ſaid, <hi>but he thinks he may live one year longer.</hi> And that's the Millſtone that hath ſunk ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſouls into the Abyſs of Hell. <hi>Senex volo, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termortuus volo:</hi> I may repent in mine old Age, and on my Death-bed.

And I may ſo often ſay, I will, and I will, till God ſay, I ſhall not. I who have had ſo long a time, and do neglect it, may chance hear the Angel ſwearing, <hi>That there ſhall be no longer time.

            <p>Thoſe men have their Day, but 'tis a ſhort one: <hi>Adhuc puſillum,</hi> and <hi>we ſhall ſee them no more.</hi> No more, till we ſee them <hi>dragged</hi> to a worſe <hi>Judgment</hi> then they now hale others. Well, if they'l not think on't, God grant we may. Our Goods, they were but lent us, and the leſs we have, the leſs we have to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for: we can but go out <hi>naked</hi> as <hi>we came in,</hi> and ſo ſhall all. Our Afflictions will not laſt for ever: and be they never ſo many, and ſharp too, yet are not our ſufferings worthy that <hi>glory that ſhall be revealed.</hi> And at moſt, thoſe Lions can do no worſe by us, than did that Lion by the man of God, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13. kill the body and gaze upon the Carcaſs.

            <p>As for thoſe frequent Apparitions, there may be ſuch, <hi>Sed non ego credulus illis.</hi> But theſe are, moſt while, pretended for the Soul alone.

            </p>
            <p>As for thoſe others reſtored to life by <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſha</hi> in the Old, or our Saviour in the New Teſtament: <hi>Quod lego, credo.</hi> And God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid any man ſhould ſtagger at ſuch plain E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences. <hi>Christ hath the Keys of Hell and Death, Rev.</hi> 1.18.

Take it as a <hi>Complaint,</hi> and ſo 'tis too; and you have three things alſo.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:49231:47"/> Firſt, the Inconſtancy of Friends: Secondly, the bewitching Pleaſures of the World: Thirdly, the Miſeries of Perſecution.</p>
            <p>But with <hi>Demas</hi> muſt we begin. He parts firſt, and he parts from <hi>Rome,</hi> from <hi>Paul,</hi> from God. Firſt, from <hi>Rome;</hi> nay, that may be well done, <hi>Exeat Aula, Qui vult eſſe pius:</hi> No man could deem it a fault to fly from <hi>Nero</hi>'s Court. And this is that ſo much commends <hi>Moſes,</hi> That he forſook the pleaſure of ſin, <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s <hi>Court, and choſe rather to ſuffer Affliction with the Children of God.</hi> But ſecondly, <hi>Demas</hi> forſakes <hi>Paul</hi> too: And that might be excuſeable in ſome Caſe alſo: For <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul exacerba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,</hi> not without ſome bitterneſs <hi>depart one from another.</hi> Or, laſt of all; He might <hi>ſecedere ad tempus,</hi> leave St. <hi>Paul</hi> for a time, and upon better thoughts return again, as did <hi>Oneſimus</hi> to his Maſter <hi>Philemon.</hi> And <hi>Beza</hi> is of that Opinion; <hi>Videtur ille poſtea reſipiſcens ad Paulum revertiſſe:</hi> But his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion ſtands upon two, but too weak Grounds: The firſt, that <hi>Timothy</hi> was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver at <hi>Rome,</hi> but once; which were much for ſuch Friends, and in ſo long a time. The ſecond, <hi>Probabile eſt,</hi> That the Epiſtle to <hi>Philemon</hi> was written after this Second E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to <hi>Timothy.</hi> All is but <hi>videtur,</hi> and <hi>probabile;</hi> and under correction, I ſhall ſay, <hi>Videtur quod non:</hi> For firſt, for <hi>Pauls</hi> going from <hi>Barnabas,</hi> as alſo of <hi>Oneſimus</hi> from <hi>Philemon,</hi> 'twas but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a parting or ſeparation. Here is a plain Dereliction:
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:49231:47"/> And ſecondly, read but this Chapter, and you ſhall ſee 'twas written very little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Death: <hi>Ego jam libor, verſ.</hi> 6. <hi>I am ready to be offered up, and the time of my Diſſolution is at hand.</hi> But in the Epiſtle to <hi>Philemon, Para mihi hoſpitium, verſ.</hi> 22. <hi>He was in hope to</hi> ſcape <hi>and come</hi> amongſt them. And ſo 'tis here ſpoken of <hi>Demas</hi> his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reliction, when <hi>Paul</hi> was ready to ſuffer, but no where is mention of <hi>Demas</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</p>
            <p>And therefore I add in the third place, That he forſook God too. <hi>Rome, Paul,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> too. For in this verſe, three things are witneſſed againſt him: Firſt, <hi>Demas hath forſaken me.</hi> Secondly, <hi>hath embraced the preſent World.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>He is gone to Theſſalonica:</hi> He had made merchandize of his Soul before, and is now gone about his other Merchandize: or he goes far e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough from <hi>Rome,</hi> leſt ſome good Friend or other ſhould labour to reclaim him. And now becauſe order carries ſome help to memory, though in the weakeſt Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours: Out of all this <hi>Chaos</hi> I ſhall ſelect ſome few Particulars to be inſiſted on, in this order.

            <p>But the Caſe is altered now with <hi>Paul:</hi> His power is (it ſeems) eclipſed: He that could cure others, cannot now free himſelf: <hi>Siſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ad Tribunal Caeſaris;</hi> and he muſt anſwer for his new Profeſſion.

            <p>No wonder then if <hi>Demas</hi> hath given the ſlip, and left this miſerable Priſoner to ſhift for himſelf. Friendſhip is like <hi>Corn</hi> in <hi>ſtony ground,</hi> ten to one if it gather root. Friends for the moſt part are like Swallows, they love our Houſes all the Summer time, and

            <p>Theſe are the Rats and Mice who love to repoſe them, and take up their reſt in the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Barns, and beſt inhabited Manſions: But if the Edifice begin to totter, and the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſhake, farewel Rats.

            <p>And that you ſee by <hi>Demas,</hi> who will be ſure to look to the time, and provide for a ſore finger in ſeaſon.

            </p>
            <p>Since the beginning of thoſe late miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Confuſions in our Land, how many good men have been cut off in Ships, Priſons, and the Royal-Scaffold? And many poor Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and Fatherleſs do yet cry out, and cry up for Juſtice at the hands of Heaven?</p>
            <p>If Chriſt ſhould ſay <hi>Sequere me,</hi> as he did to <hi>Peter,</hi> Go follow your Friends, your Leaders, your Betters, and drink of their Cup, What ſhould we do? We muſt do that, or do worſe: And therefore where St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Sword doth come, God give them St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Courage.</p>
            <p>But all who ſuffer are not Saints, nor are all Martyrs who die by the Hang-mans hand for their Religions ſake.

            <p>You can tell me of the treachery of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions; the Churliſhneſs of Inn-keepers; the Dangers of the Way. <hi>Sparta</hi> would hardly give a <hi>ſtranger</hi> any admittance: the beſt place in the world for <hi>old men,</hi> one of the worſt for <hi>strangers.</hi> The <hi>Chinois</hi> kept them all out.

            <p>Some will ſay this was done in the <hi>dayes of Ignorance,</hi> which as 'tis true, ſo 'tis not all. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> will tell you, 'twas one of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s ſins; <hi>They oppreſſed the Stranger wrongfully, Cap.</hi> 22.29.

            <p>This is the condition of <hi>Strangers,</hi> and ſuch you ſee were theſe in the Text. <hi>Yet God ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered no man to do them wrong.</hi>

               <q>Now there cryed a certain woman of the wives of the Sons of the Prophets unto <hi>Eliſha,</hi> ſaying; Thy ſervant mine huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is dead: And thou knoweſt that thy ſervant did fear the Lord: And the Creditor is come to take unto him my two Sons to be Bond-men. And <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſaid unto her, what ſhall I do for thee? tell me, What haſt thou in thy Houſe? And ſhe ſaid, Thine Hand-maid hath not any thing in the houſe, ſave a pot of Oyl.</q>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>EATH, Sorrow, Penury,</hi> and <hi>Fears</hi> begin the <hi>Text; Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Deliverance,</hi> and <hi>Plenty</hi> end it. Here's a Story fraught with much variety. Many are the Miſeries, and yet a Salve for every Sore. After <hi>Poverty</hi> comes <hi>Plenty:</hi>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:49231:65"/> unexpected Mercy follows cut-throat Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty; Fear and Danger find Deliverance.</p>
            <p>You have here the brief Relation of a Man and his Wife; of a Widow and her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; of a Creditor and his Debtor; Of a Prophet and his Client or Petitioner.</p>
            <p>The Woman acts the greateſt part, in whom you may obſerve three things: Her <hi>Diſtreſs,</hi> Her <hi>Addreſs;</hi> Her <hi>Redreſs.</hi> 1. What ſhe ſuffered: 2. To whom ſhe applyed her ſelf: 3. What the Iſſue was. Her <hi>Diſtreſs</hi> is fully ſhewed in three reſpects. 1. In the loſs of a good Husband. 2. <hi>Ecce Creditor,</hi> ſhe is like to looſe her Children after. 3. Her poverty and inability to relieve her ſelf, or them.</p>
            <p>We ſhall begin with the Husband: He is ſaid to be <hi>Filius Prophetarum,</hi> and a good man, and therefore the loſs the greater. Where (by the way) thoſe <hi>Prophets</hi> were not only ſuch as did foretell things to come, and are often called <hi>Seers</hi> in Scripture, but alſo ſuch as did <hi>interpret</hi> and <hi>expound</hi> the <hi>Law, teach</hi> and <hi>instruct</hi> the People, and pray for the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Filii Prophetarum</hi> were ſuch as were bred up in Learning, and fitted to ſucceed the <hi>Prophets,</hi> either at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> or in the leſſer <hi>Synagogues</hi> abroad in the Country. And we ſhall note in them three things: <hi>Cohabitation, Subordination, Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Firſt, their <hi>Cohabitation</hi> in the <hi>Schools</hi> and <hi>Nurſeries</hi> of <hi>Learning.</hi> Secondly, their <hi>Subordination</hi> and riſing by degrees. Whence
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:49231:66"/> the younger are called <hi>Filii Prophetarum.</hi> Thirdly, their <hi>Preparation</hi> and fitting them to the work they were to be imployed in, not <hi>leaping</hi> into the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> but <hi>acquiring</hi> ſome competent knowledge and meaſure of <hi>Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> before they preſumed to offer themſelves abroad unto the World.</p>
            <p>Firſt, For their <hi>Cohabitation</hi> in certain <hi>Schools</hi> and <hi>Nurſeries</hi> of <hi>Learning,</hi> read but 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.3. at <hi>Bethel; verſ.</hi> 5. at <hi>Jericho;</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.38. at <hi>Gilgal:</hi> Unto which add 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.1. <hi>Acts</hi> 22.3.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For their <hi>Subordination</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</hi> You have <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons; Prieſts and Levites. <hi>Principes Levitarum; &amp; Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipes Princip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>, Numb.</hi> 3.32. In the New Teſtament we have our Saviour the High-Prieſt, twelve Apoſtles, ſeventy Diſciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.1. After his Death, <hi>Apoſtles, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Deacons.</hi> After the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> dayes, <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Prieſts, Deacons.</hi> I too well know <hi>Heſterni Illi,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> called <hi>Praxeas.</hi> Some later Writers have had their new-found and different thoughts touching thoſe <hi>Church-Degrees</hi> and <hi>Hierarchy.</hi> But the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentient <hi>Judgment</hi> of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and univerſal continued <hi>practiſe</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> ſhall ever be reputed by me, <hi>The beſt Interpreter of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third thing is their <hi>Preparation.</hi> The two firſt make good the laſt. And we muſt be <hi>Diſcentes antequam Docentes,</hi> as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaid; <hi>Learners</hi> before we can be <hi>Teachers.</hi> They tell us greater <hi>Gifts</hi> were reſerved for
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:49231:66"/> theſe times, and thoſe dayes of <hi>Ignorance</hi> are paſt; <hi>Amen,</hi> ſay I. But what if our <hi>Gifts</hi> be leſs, and our <hi>Preſumption</hi> more? They tell us of <hi>Jeremy</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> both Children; of <hi>Amos</hi> an Herd-man; of <hi>Eliſha</hi> (this <hi>Eliſha</hi>) taken from the Plough.</p>
            <p>But ſure <hi>Jeremy</hi> was <hi>Propheta Natus, Jer.</hi> 1.5. yet was afraid to undertake the <hi>Calling</hi> till he had a <hi>command,</hi> and a <hi>promiſe,</hi> and a <hi>touch</hi> too, <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>Daniel</hi> was bred up a <hi>Scholar, Dan.</hi> 1.4. and at <hi>v.</hi> 17. God gave him <hi>knowledge and skill in all learning and wiſdome.</hi> And <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos</hi> had his ſpecial <hi>call from God, Amos</hi> 7.15. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I have read indeed of Learning gotten without Learning. <hi>Archippus Ingenio pro Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bris utebatur. Anthony</hi> had the Heavens for his School-maſter. <hi>Nepotianus</hi> his memory alone made him learned; ſo that from a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier he became a Prieſt. <hi>Johannes Trajectenſis Epiſcopus à Plauſtro ad Pulpita aſcendit, Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitùs edoctus.</hi> Nay, I have read of one, <hi>Qui omnium Linguarum notitiam ex morbo adeptus eſt.</hi> An happy Sickneſs. What ſhall I ſay of theſe, but that <hi>Spiritus ubi vult ſpirat, John</hi> 3.8. The Creator of Spirits can inſpire how, and when, and whom he pleaſe. And theſe and the like Examples are not for Imitation, but Admiration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solomon</hi> hath a good Rule, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.27. <hi>Prepare thy Materials, and then build thine houſe.</hi> Firſt get <hi>Learning,</hi> and then expect a <hi>Call.</hi> 'Tis St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Rule too, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de Lectioni,</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>Give thy ſelf wholly to it.</hi> v. 16. <hi>perſiſt, continue.</hi>

            <pb n="124" facs="tcp:49231:67"/>
            <p>But beware of thoſe <hi>Clouds without Rain,</hi> that boaſt themſelves of their <hi>falſe Gifts, Prov.</hi> 25.14. Who inſtead of <hi>dividing the Word aright,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.15. do ſlice and chop it out without Rules, Method, Matter, any thing, full of <hi>Battologies, Tautologies, vain Repetitions,</hi> tumbling out <hi>Non-ſenſe</hi> with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible Confidence.</p>
            <p>The ſecond obſervable thing: This <hi>Filius Prophetarum</hi> was <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xoratus,</hi> a married Man. We meet with three ſorts of men: The firſt are Enemies to Women: The ſecond to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages: The third to Prieſts marriages. As for Women-haters in general, I could wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly let them paſs by as unworthy to be thought upon, but that ſome of them think it their greateſt praiſe when they can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily diſpraiſe that Sex. I can think them no better then Cowards that are ſure to ſtrike when they cannot be ſtricken again.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſs there's many a <hi>Jezebel, Herodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, Meſſalina,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Jones</hi> of <hi>Naples:</hi> There are many ſuch as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſtigmatizeth, <hi>Mulier ſecularis Organum Satanae:</hi> But 'tis <hi>Secularis</hi> then, 'tis a bad woman muſt be ſo bad an Inſtrument. <hi>Tertullian</hi> cryes out, <hi>Tu es Diaboli Janua, Tu es, &amp;c.</hi> But I ſee no reaſon why one <hi>Eve</hi> ſhould make us angry with the whole Sex, more then one <hi>Adam</hi> who did perſonate and repreſent Mankind, and by his Tranſgreſſion conveyed ſin to all his Poſterity.</p>
            <p>And though the Apoſtle ſome where layes the blame on <hi>Eve</hi> for the priority in the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:49231:67"/> Tranſgreſſion, <hi>Adam was not deceived, but the Woman,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.14. Yet for Natures Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>green, and Sins Tranſmiſſion, the ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſends us all to <hi>Adam. Omnes in Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.22. <hi>All died in Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might hear bring in <hi>Cyril</hi> ſpeaking but untowardly of Women; but he elſewhere gives them their Right again: And the like doth <hi>Hieronimus: Tertullian</hi> after ſo many ſhrewd ſpeeches, yet he allows them a place in Heaven; though not as Women, for he thinks they muſt change their Sex into that of men. <hi>Idem Sexus qui eſt viris.</hi> The <hi>Turk</hi> in his <hi>Alcoran</hi> ſhuts all women out of Heaven; But let him go for a <hi>Turk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some may think better of him who gave the Gods thanks that he was not born a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. But I am ſure he had never been born without one.</p>
            <p>We muſt paſs from Women-haters to Wedlock-haters; Such as like the Sex, but not the Knot. They can love a Woman, but not a Wife. There are perchance too many <hi>Libertines</hi> of this Opinion in theſe dayes: of old, the <hi>Adamites</hi> and <hi>Albanenſes:</hi> of late, the <hi>David-Georgians</hi> taught <hi>Matrimony</hi> to be evil in it ſelf: The <hi>Tatians, nil differre à Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatione: Durand de Waldach; Matrimonium nil aliud eſſe quam occultum Meretricium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O Enemies of Mankind! O Doctrine of Devils! Foretold, condemned by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3. Matrimony inſtituted in the time of Innocency, and honoured by our Saviours preſence in the Goſpel, 2 <hi>John.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="126" facs="tcp:49231:68"/>
            <p>Well, if not all Marriages, yet Prieſts-Marriages are cryed down, hewed down by a ſtronger hand. Indeed they be, but yet with greater ſtrength, juſtice, reaſons, powerfully maintained: I ſhall but touch this ſtring: 'Tis a common queſtion between us and the Papiſts. 'Tis ſufficient, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Patriarchs, Prophets, Apoſtles, and ancient Biſhops and Fathers of the <hi>Church</hi> we ſtill find married men, who lived more chaſtly with their Wives, without Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines, then theſe now with their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines without Wives. But above all, we have the Apoſtles warrant for it, <hi>Marriage is honourable in all, Heb.</hi> 13.4. And the Son of the Prophet here was a married man.</p>
            <p>The third Obſervation: <hi>He was a good man; He did fear the Lord.</hi> Yea, will ſome body ſay; <hi>So did the Devils alſo, Ja.</hi> 2.19. Nay, not ſo; 'Tis <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> there, they do more than <hi>fear,</hi> they <hi>tremble,</hi> and <hi>alwayes tremble:</hi> A word taken from the waves of the Sea, <hi>that are never at reſt:</hi> No <hi>Lucida intervalla,</hi> no hope, no intermiſſion: <hi>Non eſt pax impiis</hi>— Leſs <hi>Diabolo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The uſual diſtinction of <hi>Fear</hi> is, into <hi>Fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> and <hi>Servile Fear.</hi> Fear to offend, and Fear to ſuffer. But Devils fear, <hi>Timore Deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis.</hi> And good men fear, <hi>Timore Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis.</hi> So is Fear taken in this place for the <hi>Worſhip of God, Veneration</hi> and <hi>Piety. Moſes</hi> will tell you that to fear God is, <hi>To keep his Commandements, Deut.</hi> 6.2. The Pſalmiſt will tell you, <hi>He that fears the Lord doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:49231:68"/> in his Commandements, Pſal.</hi> 112.1. <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, He that fears the Lord will depart from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, Prov.</hi> 3.7. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.2. <hi>He that walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightneſs feareth the Lord.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſums it up in three words, <hi>Titus</hi> 2.12. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brie juſte, pie.</hi> Thoſe three duties concern God, our Neighbour, and our Selves. <hi>Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> is for God: <hi>Juſtice</hi> for our Neigbours: and <hi>Sobriety</hi> for our own ſelves. And theſe make a man good indeed. Theſe are like <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons three-twiſted cords, not quickly broken,</hi> Eccl. 4.12.</p>
            <p>Religion conſiſts not in Lip-labour, nor in hanging down the he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, or rowling up the eye, nor in tumbling of the Bible (though all theſe may have their Uſes) a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> an <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> a <hi>Time ſerver,</hi> an <hi>Any-thing</hi> may do all theſe and more too.</p>
            <p>Thus have we gone along <hi>cum Filio Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarum,</hi> A well-bred man, a married man, a good man, that did <hi>fear the Lord,</hi> I, and yet a poor man, a miſerable poor man: He li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved poor, and he died poor. His <hi>Inventory</hi> was quickly made: <hi>One pot of Oyl,</hi> and little more, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. But this is not the worſt: <hi>Ecce Creditor:</hi> He had bound his Sons for default of payment, to be the Uſurers Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: O hard Condition! He forfeits his Bond: They their Liberty. Well, I ſee then, <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Poverty</hi> may dwell under one Roof, ay, or woe the while.</p>
            <p>Not to ſpeak of Philoſophers, who found no greater ſweet then in their Poverty. Wo to thoſe Primitive times when men ſold all,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:49231:69"/> and felt a great deal of felicity in disburden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves of thoſe Cares which brought ſo many thouſands unto ruin. Wo to the Martyrs and Confeſſors, <hi>Antiquos-Hodier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos,</hi> who preferred a Good Conſcience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the Riches and Pleaſures of the World; who <hi>left all to follow Chriſt. Vade, Vende</hi> was our Saviours Leſſon, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. And to the Ruler, <hi>Chap.</hi> 18. <hi>Sell all.</hi> His own Poſſeſſions were none at all: He <hi>had not where to lay his head.</hi> And St. <hi>Peter</hi> could ſay, <hi>Silver and Gold have I none.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Concluſion muſt be: Mans Life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth not in the Abundance of thoſe things that he poſſeſſeth, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>Nay, but what often-times falls out, <hi>Pecunia tua tecum pereat,</hi> as the Apoſtle told <hi>Symon Magus.</hi> Many men <hi>periſh</hi> with their <hi>money. Vere miſerabiles: Bis miſerabiles:</hi> Twice mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable; for their too much Care, and their too little Conſcience.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Bernard</hi> will tell you that wicked men ace not Rich: <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> That they are not men: And how the Devil is <hi>Divitum Canis;</hi> The Devil, like a Dog, doth wait upon them (<hi>ad Pop. Ant. Hom.</hi> 53. One ſaith (<hi>Ber. de mod. vivendi ad Sororem, Serm.</hi> 8.) <hi>Nullus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrat res terrenas ſine peccato;</hi> He makes them all unjuſt Stewards. St. <hi>Hierom</hi> hath a ſaying, <hi>Dives aut Iniquus, aut Iniqui Filius:</hi> The rich man muſt either be an unjuſt man, or the ſon of one.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour goes beyond them all: <hi>It is harder for a Camel to paſs through the eye of a
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:49231:69"/> Needle, then for a rich man to enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God:</hi> And in his mildeſt terms he leaves them to a <hi>Quam difficile: Mark</hi> 10. 'Tis a very difficult thing to be rich, and righteous too. And yet here lyes the <hi>Totum Hominis:</hi> moſt mens chiefeſt care is, How they may leave <hi>golden Children,</hi> and <hi>vaſt Revenues,</hi> and <hi>call their Land after their own Names, Pſal.</hi> 49. But thoſe very Names in time are loſt. Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Lands find new Names, new Lords, and oft-times are poſſeſſed by our mortal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. But the ſins, the ſins by which thoſe Lands were gotten, they ſtick cloſe for many Generations, like Leproſie to the wall.</p>
            <p>So that in the ſecond place; <hi>Riches</hi> are no <hi>Argument</hi> of <hi>Mans felicity</hi> or <hi>Gods favour:</hi> no Concluding Argument.</p>
            <p>I know <hi>Abraham, Lot, Iſaac, Jacob, Job, Ezechias,</hi> and a world beſide, were <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Great; Rich</hi> and <hi>Righteous</hi> too: And little <hi>Zacheus</hi> is a <hi>Child of Abraham, Luke</hi> 19. But the having of <hi>Wealth</hi> makes not up the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. For <hi>all things come to all alike,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon.</hi> And no man knows <hi>Love</hi> or <hi>Hatred</hi> by all that is before them, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9. Wherefore as the Apoſtle ſaid of Meat, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.8. <hi>Meat commends us not to God:</hi> And <hi>Wealth</hi> commends us not to God. All is in the Uſe.</p>
            <p>The like by <hi>Poverty,</hi> which as it often-times befalls Gods Children, ſo is it (and that not ſeldom) <hi>A portion for the wicked, Prov.</hi> 30.8. <hi>Agur</hi> deprecates both <hi>Poverty</hi> and <hi>Riches</hi> as two Extreams; <hi>Give me neither Poverty nor Riches, feed me with food convenient for me: leſt
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:49231:70"/> if</hi> he were <hi>rich,</hi> he might grow proud, <hi>if</hi> he were <hi>poor,</hi> he might fall to <hi>thieving,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>One compares <hi>Poverty</hi> to the River <hi>Rhenus,</hi>
               <q>
                  <p>Et quos naſcentes explorat gurgite Rhenus.</p>
                  <bibl>
                     <hi>Claudian.</hi>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>It tries what Mettal men are made of. And ſure 'tis a very hard thing for a man in <hi>want</hi> not to <hi>envy</hi> or <hi>grudge,</hi> or <hi>cheat</hi> or <hi>ſteal.</hi> And few men have learnt that Leſſon of St. <hi>Paul; I have learnt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in what ſtate I am, therewith to be content,</hi> Phil. 4.11.</p>
            <p>You have here a <hi>poor Prophet,</hi> and a <hi>godly Prophet:</hi> And firſt this <hi>Poverty</hi> of his might proceed from the hard-heartedneſs of the Jews, and their Impiety; who withheld their <hi>Tythes:</hi> For of this doth God complain, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.8.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Perchance he was not called to any <hi>publick Office</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> but had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed his <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>Patrimony</hi> in his Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and yet <hi>Preferment</hi> came but halting on. It hath been a <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> of thoſe later times. Many men ſpend many years in the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and are driven after all to ſet up their <hi>Reſt</hi> there: or marry ſome broken <hi>Chamber-maid;</hi> or ſerve for <hi>Micah</hi>'s <hi>wages, Judg.</hi> 17. And leave the reſt to their worſhipful Patroneſs to buy Lace and Painting.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This Story fell out in a time of War, and a bloody War too, as you may read in the former Chapt. And the no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to hear of thoſe <hi>Miſeries</hi> that do follow <hi>War.</hi> One of our <hi>Henry</hi>'s ſaid, that <hi>Bellona</hi>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:49231:70"/> had three Hand-maids; <hi>Fire, Famine,</hi> and <hi>Sword:</hi> But our woful Experience hath found out many more, <hi>Tortures, Butcheries, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhments,</hi> and a thing they call <hi>Living by Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,</hi> or <hi>Free-quarter,</hi> with <hi>Plunder</hi> to boot. So that if any one wonder that the <hi>Prophet</hi> had but <hi>one pot of Oyl,</hi> he may rather wonder that any one was left him; And he might <hi>well be poor.</hi>

            <p>Once I am ſure 'twas not his <hi>prodigality,</hi> or any other <hi>debauched Courſe</hi> of his that made him <hi>poor:</hi> For he <hi>did fear the Lord:</hi> And <hi>Tu nôſti,</hi> ſaith the Widow to <hi>Eliſha,</hi> the man of God did know ſo much: And without this, <hi>Poverty</hi> may be as damnable as the moſt cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Riches</hi> in the world. And therefore <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> the Great ſaid true, That ſome men are <hi>his Miſerabiles: Hic ob Inopiam rerum, illic ob nequitiam Meritorum.</hi> None ſo poor as he that wants <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> too: He is ſure to ſuffer here and hereafter alſo.</p>
            <p>Now come we to the Height of all her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery: <hi>Ecce Creditor.</hi> She hath loſt her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band: A good Husband. She is left poor, very poor. All her Comfort is in her two ſmall Children: <hi>And lo, the Creditor is come to take them away, and make them his Bond-ſlaves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of all loſſes the loſs of Liberty is one of the greateſt. There was no hope of one Jew ſold unto another, till the Year of <hi>Jubile</hi> came; And then if he had a <hi>Wife</hi> and <hi>Children</hi> in the time of his Slavery, they muſt be none of his. For this very Cauſe many choſe rather to continue Slaves for ever. The <hi>Affection</hi> they
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:49231:71"/> bare to their <hi>Wife</hi> and <hi>Children</hi> made them <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get their Father,</hi> and <hi>their Fathers houſe,</hi> and they became <hi>Bored Servants</hi> for the time to come, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. Nor was there any hope of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom afterward.</p>
            <p>No marvel then if the poor Woman cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; <hi>Clamavit mulier.</hi> There is a ſaying, <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae Leves loquuntur, ingentes ſtupent:</hi> Light Sorrows ſpeak when greater ſilent are. And it might ſeem then ſomewhat to leſſen her Sorrow, that ſhe could, and did Cry. 'Tis true; In ſome ſudden and unexpected Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>Vox faucibus haeret,</hi> the unexpectedneſs and greatneſs of Sorrow doth ſtop the Floud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, and there are found thoſe, who could neither <hi>weep</hi> nor <hi>ſpeak</hi> for a while: But vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Motions</hi> are not laſting, and the <hi>thickeſt Cloud</hi> will be broken, and the <hi>Rain</hi> will fall. <hi>Tears</hi> and <hi>Words</hi> will find <hi>vent. Tell me ye Mothers,</hi> tell me what you would do if you ſhould ſee the mercileſs <hi>Officer</hi> or <hi>Souldier</hi> ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on your Child for his prey, if but one Child? But <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trumque Filium!</hi> Both, All, and All without hope of <hi>Redemption!</hi> Not one left to comfort the poor Mother in her Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity!</p>
            <p>Me thinks I ſee <hi>Rebecka</hi>'s ſwoln heart rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to break, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. when ſhe counſels <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> to fly from the fury of his Brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> who had ſworn his Death. <hi>O why ſhould I be deprived of both of you in one day?</hi> And that witty Complaint of the Woman of <hi>Tekoa</hi> did pierce <hi>Davids</hi> heart: <hi>Thy Hand-maid had two Sons; they ſtrove; they fought, and one is ſlain:
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:49231:71"/> The Kinred call for Juſtice; and lo, they'l quench my Coal which is left: O King, without thy help and pardon, I ſhall be deprived of them both.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here's a <hi>widow,</hi> a <hi>poor widow</hi> deprived of her beſt <hi>Comfort,</hi> and now like to be robbed of her <hi>Children</hi> alſo. Well might ſhe have borrowed <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s mournful Complaint out of <hi>Jeremy: O ye that paſs by, behold and ſee if there be any ſorrow like unto my ſorrow.</hi> Let Fathers ſpeak, who <hi>exeunt hominem,</hi> leave off to be men, if they leave off <hi>natural affection.</hi> Let <hi>Mothers</hi> ſpeak (if Schools diſtinguiſh right) their Love is more fervent, though the <hi>Fathers</hi> love be more conſtant. Let all thoſe ſpeak who are ſo much troubled at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry common <hi>Croſs, Loſs,</hi> or <hi>Affliction.</hi> What would they ſay if <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> muſt looſe all? If they muſt go hand in hand with <hi>Job?</hi> If with this <hi>poor widow, Goods</hi> and <hi>Children,</hi> and All muſt be loſt, and for ought they know without the hope of any <hi>Jubile</hi> or <hi>Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we may ſee the <hi>affection</hi> of <hi>Parents</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their <hi>Children.</hi> How many years doth <hi>Jacob</hi> lament the <hi>ſuppoſed death</hi> of his <hi>beloved Joſeph?</hi> How bitterly doth <hi>David</hi> bewail the <hi>untimely death</hi> of his <hi>ungracious Abſolon? Anna</hi> calls young <hi>Toby</hi> (ſorrowing for his Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) <hi>the Staff of her old Age,</hi> the Staff in her hand that ſhe went by.</p>
            <p>Stories will tell you of ſome <hi>Fathers</hi> that have given their <hi>own eyes</hi> to ſave their <hi>Sons;</hi> of thoſe who have reſigned their <hi>Crowns,</hi> their
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:49231:72"/> Loves, their Lives, and all to do their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren good.</p>
            <p>I will add but one <hi>Example</hi> more (though of many in that one) in the third <hi>Punick War,</hi> when the choiceſt young <hi>Noble-men</hi> were ſent away <hi>Hostages</hi> into <hi>Sicily:</hi> The <hi>Mothers</hi> accompany them to the <hi>Ship</hi> with all <hi>expreſſions of ſorrow:</hi> Thence they get up the top of the <hi>Rocks,</hi> and at their going out of ſight, the <hi>Mothers</hi> (many of them) <hi>cast themſelves head-long into the Sea:</hi> A ſad farewel. Yet were their Sons ſent away for <hi>Hoſtages,</hi> and not taken away for <hi>Slaves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus doth <hi>Love</hi> deſcend in a full carrier from the <hi>Parents</hi> to the <hi>Children.</hi> But I fear the <hi>Motion</hi> is very ſlow in riſing upward from the <hi>Children</hi> to the <hi>Parents.</hi> Sure this <hi>Motion</hi> is againſt the <hi>Hill:</hi> we pauſe too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. The Poet ſaid true
<q>Filius ante diem—</q>
            </p>
            <p>And many ſay in their hearts what <hi>Eſau</hi> did <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.41. <hi>The dayes of mourning for my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are at hand.</hi> He cannot live long. And then a ſad Suit, and a merry heart: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of that <hi>Lex talionis:</hi> As ſure as a day they are paid again in their own Coyn: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the ſting of a guilty Conſcience is ſure to follow them as long as they live.</p>
            <p>O that <hi>Children</hi> would but think upon the many <hi>Cares,</hi> and <hi>Fears,</hi> and <hi>Coſt</hi> that <hi>Parents</hi> are put to for their <hi>Children,</hi> and with what neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, contempt, and diſobedience 'tis oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:49231:72"/> repayed: But take heed; remember that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.1.2. <hi>Filii obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Honour thy Father and Mother, which is the firſt Commandement with promiſe.</hi> The <hi>Promiſe</hi> is <hi>long life,</hi> which all deſire: And our <hi>undutifulneſs to our Parents</hi> cuts of the thread of life, and ſends men headlong to the grave, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now come we to thoſe <hi>Horſe-Leeches,</hi> whoſe <hi>Teeth are ſpears,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayes, <hi>And they devour the poor of the earth,</hi> Prov. 30.14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ecce Creditor:</hi> The <hi>Father</hi> is dead: The <hi>Mother</hi> almoſt diſtracted: The <hi>Children</hi> in deſpair. The whoſe <hi>little Houſe</hi> nought but <hi>Tears</hi> and <hi>Terrour:</hi> And in comes this <hi>Moth-of-men,</hi> this <hi>Canker</hi> that hath eaten up many good Houſes and their Maſters to boot: In comes the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurer,</hi> one <hi>qui laetatur de lachrymis proximorum:</hi> when all weep, he laughs. He hopes to gain wherever the loſs fall; and he riſeth moſt while by the ruins of the poor.</p>
            <p>Of all Vertues <hi>Mercy</hi> is the beſt; It <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms</hi> us to <hi>our Maker,</hi> and <hi>hath the promiſe of a reward, both in this life, and in the life to come,</hi> Matth. 5.7. <hi>Bleſſed are the merciful, for they ſhall be ſure of mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The object of <hi>Mercy</hi> is <hi>Miſery. To him that is afflicted, pity ſhould be ſhewed,</hi> Job 6.14. So <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 41. <hi>Bleſſed is he that conſidereth the poor and needy.</hi> And <hi>Solomon; He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the Lord; and look what he giveth, God will pay him again,</hi> Prov. 19.17.</p>
            <pb n="136" facs="tcp:49231:73"/>
            <p>Now of all People in miſery, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth none ſo much as the <hi>Widow</hi> and the <hi>Fatherleſs:</hi> And therefore one ſpecial Branch in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law was a <hi>Proviſo</hi> for them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.22. <hi>Ye ſhall not afflict any widow or father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs child And when ye make a Feaſt, call the fatherleſs and the widow,</hi> Deut. 16. Nay, thrice in that Chapter you are bid to <hi>rejoyce in your Feaſts, but call the fatherleſs and the widow:</hi> No good feaſting without them.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe at <hi>Harveſt-time;</hi> at <hi>Olive ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering,</hi> and <hi>Grape gathering,</hi> ſtill <hi>Remember the widow and fatherleſs,</hi> Deut. 24. And one of the Charges which <hi>Aſaph</hi> gave the Judges, was <hi>to help the poor and fatherleſs,</hi> Pſal. 82.3, 4. When <hi>Eliphaz</hi> thought to load <hi>Job</hi> with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, he tells him, <hi>he had ſent away the widows empty;</hi> and <hi>he had not relieved the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,</hi> Chap. 9 And in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94. one of their crying ſins was; <hi>They ſlay the widow and the ſtranger, and put the fatherleſs to death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well then, ſee here one that regardeth nor God, nor Man, nor Widow, nor Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs, All's fiſh that comes to his Net: Hee'l have away the Children: And let the Mother break her heart; All's one to him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Debt</hi> could not be great: But the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit</hi> was too great. The <hi>Debtor</hi> was a <hi>good man,</hi> and therefore would not borrow, what in all probability he could not pay again. For 'tis the <hi>Note</hi> of an <hi>ungodly man</hi> to run into <hi>Debt,</hi> without any care how he may get out, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.21. And therefore the leſs the <hi>Debt</hi>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:49231:73"/> was, the greater was this Monſter.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Text</hi> (or the <hi>Tranſlation</hi> rather) calls him <hi>Creditor.</hi> The word indeed doth ſignifie a <hi>Creditor,</hi> an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurer,</hi> and a <hi>Biter</hi> too: Now 'tis to be ſuppoſed, A <hi>good woman</hi> would uſe the mildeſt term: And next, The <hi>Jews</hi> were forbidden to take <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury</hi> one of another; they were indeed; that was the Law: But the practice was quite contrary. They did take <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury,</hi> and exact it too. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 5.7. <hi>You exact <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury every one of his Brother:</hi> So that it was a common ſin, And afterward <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 22.12. <hi>Thou haſt taken <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury and Increaſe, and thou haſt greedily gained of thy Neighbour by Extortion, and haſt forgotten me, ſaith the Lord God.</hi> Every word carrieth force with it; <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury, Increaſe, Extortion, Greedy-Extortion, And haſt forgotten me and my Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Gods Laws cry it down directly, and <hi>in terminis.</hi> Mans Laws at moſt do but tolerate it, preſcribing bounds to inſatiable <hi>Avarice.</hi> One ſaith, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſura aliquando tolerata, nunquam approbata;</hi> that it hath been ſometimes tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, but never approved of.</p>
            <p>I, but ſaith the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurer,</hi> If it be evil, why is it permitted? Nay, there needed no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, if 'twere not Evil: 'tis ſuffered as the <hi>giving a Bill of divorce,</hi> Matth. 19.8. on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the <hi>hardneſs of mens hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All Countries, all Laws have cryed the Trade down (for to that Credit it is now gotten) one ſpeaks it as bad as <hi>Murder,</hi> 'tis <hi>Cato.</hi> Another calls it <hi>Statute-Thievery.</hi> By the Civil and Common Law, they are <hi>Inter Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vos
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:49231:74"/> Maledicti, Inter mortuos Inſepulti;</hi> curſed alive, and not be buried being dead.</p>
            <p>One tells us, <hi>Solon</hi> in <hi>Athens, Lucullus</hi> in <hi>Aſia, Caeſar</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> did as much good in their dayes by putting down <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurers,</hi> as did our Chriſtian Kings that <hi>expelled the Jews</hi> (thoſe old <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurers</hi>) out of their Dominions. <hi>Boterus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might ſay much more out of our own Country-men and late Writers; but to what end, as long as the Laws permit. There is no doubt but the Jews will find Scholars enough to learn their Trade.</p>
            <p>Now come we to the ſecond General Part, <hi>Her Addreſs.</hi> To whom ſhe makes her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint: <hi>She cryed unto</hi> Eliſha.</p>
            <p>Here we are taught then to whom we ought to addreſs our ſelves in time of <hi>Adverſitie.</hi> This <hi>widow</hi> directs us ad <hi>Eliſham.</hi> What, to the Prophet? I, to the Prophet. That Courſe is ſafe and warrantable that's taught by God. <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.7. God tells <hi>Abimelech</hi> that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was a <hi>Prophet,</hi> and ſhould <hi>pray</hi> for him: And <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. <hi>Abraham prayed, and Abimelech was healed.</hi> In the ſecond of <hi>Joel, verſ.</hi> 17. we find that the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and the <hi>Miniſters of the Lord</hi> were to <hi>pray for the People:</hi> And then <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. <hi>The Lord promiſed to have pity upon the People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 3. <hi>Eliſha</hi> procured <hi>water</hi> to ſave <hi>three Kings</hi> and their <hi>Armies</hi> from <hi>periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> and the <hi>Victory</hi> beſides. In 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5. <hi>Naaman</hi> is cured of his <hi>Leproſie</hi> by <hi>Eliſha.</hi> In 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. The King of <hi>Syria</hi> being <hi>ſick,</hi> ſends to <hi>Eliſha. Nihil inconſulto Sacerdote.</hi> In War,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:49231:74"/> in Peace, in Sickneſs, in every thing, ſtill the <hi>Prophets</hi> were conſulted with, their counſel, their prayers ever in moſt eſteem.</p>
            <p>Nor was this Courſe in the Old Teſtament only, but 'twas the conſtant and appointed Courſe in all Ages, and to the end of the World. <hi>Oſtende te Sacerdoti,</hi> ſaid our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.4. <hi>Go ſhew thy ſelf unto the Prieſt.</hi> Or if that refer to <hi>Moſes</hi> Law; yet are the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> called <hi>Pastors, Teachers, Guides, Fathers, Angels.</hi> Their <hi>duty</hi> too is to <hi>pray</hi> for the <hi>People, to watch for mens Souls, Heb.</hi> 13.17. And therefore they muſt be called upon, and ſent to in times of <hi>affliction and diſtreſs,</hi> James 5.14. <hi>Is any man ſick among you, let him call for the Elders of the Church, and they ſhall pray over him,</hi> &amp;c. Not Lay-Elders (I warrant you) but the <hi>Elders of the Church,</hi> ſuch as are put into the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Ordained Preachers,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.7. ſuch as muſt <hi>feed the Flock,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.1, 2. But now what St. <hi>Paul</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3. <hi>The time is come, when men will not endure ſound Doctrine, but after their own Luſts, heap to themſelves Teachers, having itching ears, turning away their Ears from the Truth, and hearkening after Fables.</hi> Inſtead of the Levites, Oxen now carry the Ark a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: And men ſeek to <hi>Diotrephes, Hymene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> or <hi>Alexanders,</hi> factious and ſeditious Spirits, rather then with the widow here, to the Prophet, to <hi>Eliſha.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="140" facs="tcp:49231:75"/>
            <p>But what <hi>Redreſs</hi> could this widow in her condition expect from <hi>Eliſha?</hi> He was poor himſelf, and therefore in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity unable to ſuccour her againſt her greedy Creditor.</p>
            <p>But what ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10. of himſelf, and of his Fellow-Labourers: Though they were <hi>poor,</hi> yet they made many <hi>rich.</hi> And ſo did <hi>Eliſha</hi> by this poor Widow in the Text. Though, I preſume, 'twas the leaſt of her thoughts when ſhe cryed unto the Prophet. <hi>Potuit emollire creditorem.</hi> The utmoſt of her hopes was, that the Prophet might prevail with her Creditor to gain ſome farther time, or ſome eaſier condition. But here you ſee how God provides for his; <hi>Exceeding abundantly,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>above all that we ask or think,</hi> Eph. 3 20. Thus was it with <hi>Abraham, Gen,</hi> 17.18. <hi>O that</hi> Iſhmael <hi>might live in thy ſight;</hi> And lo God gives him a Son by old <hi>Sarah.</hi> Thus <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 21.4. <hi>Petiit vitam, &amp; dediſti longam vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam,</hi> &amp;c. So the lame man, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects but ſome poor Alms, and he hears, <hi>Surge, ambula, Ariſe, and walk.</hi> And ſo this widow, ſhe deſired but only to eaſe her grief, by opening it to the Prophets, or at the moſt, that he might obtain ſome favour for her from the Uſurer, and ſhe finds where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with not only to diſcharge the whole Debt, but a ſufficient and plentiful livelyhood for her ſelf, and her Children.</p>
            <pb n="141" facs="tcp:49231:75"/>
            <p>Thus doth God give men, good men, <hi>aut quod petunt, aut quod expedit,</hi> what they ask, or what is better, that which he in his Wiſdom knows moſt needful for them. If they ask <hi>Stones,</hi> or <hi>Serpents,</hi> ſuch things as may hurt them, they may be denyed; but if they ask <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>good things,</hi> things may tend to their real intereſt and welfare, they are ſure to have their Petitions granted. For <hi>God will give Grace and Glory, and no good thing will he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold from ſuch as lead a godly life.</hi>

               <hi>ſine Conſenſu remittitur.</hi> Why may not a Child be ſaved without his conſent, as well as ſin without his conſent?

            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Cryſologus</hi> proves it out of <hi>Mark</hi> 9. where a poor Father deſires help for his Son, <hi>who had been vexed with a Devil from his Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</hi> Chriſt tells the Father at the 23. <hi>verſe, If thou canſt believe it.

            </p>
            <p>Many more are the Arguments our Men do uſe, and thoſe (for ought I ſee) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable As how <hi>Baptiſm</hi> came in the place of <hi>Circumciſion.</hi> How our Saviour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>young Children to be brought unto him, &amp;c.</hi> How the Children of the Faithful are holy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall only add, the practiſe of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, Primitive Church, which I take to be the beſt Expoſitor of Scripture. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tells us of <hi>whole houſholds baptized,</hi> Acts 16.15, 33. 1 Cor. 1.16. But I cannot prove there were <hi>young Children</hi> there: and who can prove there were not?</p>
            <p>Go we then to thoſe who were Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary with the Apoſtles, and whoſe Names are regiſtred in Holy Writ.

            <p>But the common Opinion of the Papiſts is peremptory; That all Infants dying without Baptiſm, are ſhut out of Heaven into a <hi>Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> an imagined place of theirs, where they ſhall feel no pain at all; no <hi>poenam ſenſus,</hi> but <hi>poenam damni:</hi> No Torments, but the Torment of Loſs, which (they all ſay) is the greateſt, to be deprived of that <hi>viſio beatifica,</hi> the ſight of God.</p>
            <p>The farther opening of the Text, will open a way to anſwer all their Arguments, unleſs it be thoſe from Authority.</p>
            <p>Now that the Fathers ſhould be ſo violent in this matter, we ſhall not wonder, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, <hi>The frailty of men,</hi> and how far the heat of Oppoſition doth oft times tranſport us.</p>

            <p>But will the Scripture ſay as much? They ſay it will: and the Maſter-Argument is this of my Text. <hi>Except a Man be born of Water and the Spirit</hi>—that is, <hi>Except a Man be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi>

            <head>The Teſtimony Given to the Reverend D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>HENRY BYAM,</hi> AT HIS BURIAL IN THE Pariſh Church of <hi>Luckham</hi> in the County of <hi>Sommerſet.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>— UNto which bleſſed and happy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, I doubt not but the ſoul of this our Reverend Father here deceaſed is already arrived, whoſe body is now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to the earth from whence it came. But there is a box of Spikenard to be poured upon it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it goes; and there is none here ſo much a <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> I hope, to account it waſted: For ſince the Wiſe-man tells us <hi>That a good Name is better than a precious oyntment,</hi> it were great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to defraud him of that now he is dead, who was ſo careful to preſerve it whilſt he was living: Eſpecially ſince this, and our tears, is all that is
<pb facs="tcp:49231:166"/> left us now to bestow upon him. But I know that by my endeavouring to rehearſe his due praiſes, I cannot but aggravate that loſs whereof I find you already but too too ſenſible: I ſhall therefore, in pity to my ſelf and you, be as brief in the relation of them as I can. And though his whole life were like a garden of Spices, repleniſht with all the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Vertues that can adorn a Chriſtian; yet I ſhall only lead you through ſome paſſages of it, where by the way you may gather your ſelves ſuch Poſies of ſpiritual flowers, as may ſerve to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume all your Actions as long as you live.</p>

               </gap> mystical order in compoſing them, but bind them up all together, that ſo (as flowers do) they may yield the ſweeter ſmell the one for the other. But
<q>— Inopem me copia fecit,</q> which to pluck firſt I know not; like a curious appetite at a ſumptuous feaſt, I am puzled with variety. And ſure I am, the Character I ſhall preſent you will be no more fit to be compared with him for worth and excellency, than his Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture now taken by an unskilful Painter, would be like him when he was flouriſhing in his perfect health and vigour: But ſuch as it is, drawn as well as I can, in water-colours you ſhall have.</p>
            <p>As his Body was
<q>Ex meliore luto, —</q> of a moſt excellent frame and conſtitution, of a Temperature well nigh <hi>Ad pondus,</hi> ſo he had a Mind as near <hi>Ad juſtitiam,</hi> moſt richly endowed: which portion of naturall parts he improved ſo well, that by the advantage of an ingenious and liberal Education, joyn'd with his own diligence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry,
<pb facs="tcp:49231:166"/> he ſoon became in his younger years one of the greateſt Ornaments of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity;
<q>— monſtrari &amp; dicier hic eſt,</q> a man of moſt excellent and polite learning; which ſeconded with Judgment and Experience, after he began to ſerve at the Altar, made him like a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and a ſhining light, lookt upon as the moſt acute and eminent Preacher of his time. Witneſs thoſe exquiſite labours of his yet extant, and thoſe other moſt elaborate pieces which I have ſeen fairly written, and (if his Executor will ſo far oblige us) ready for the Preſs. Witneſs his being choſen by the general and unanimous conſent of the whole Clergy of this Dioceſs, to ſerve at the Parliament for their Clerk of the Convocation. Witneſs his moſt honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable attaining of the Degrees of Batchelour and Doctour of Divinity; and last of all his being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to ſerve near His Majesties Perſon, as his Chaplain in Ordinary, his Majeſty doing him the honour to be his conſtant Auditour, admiring equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his Learning and his Loyalty.</p>
            <p>And in which of theſe he excelled moſt 'tis hard to ſpeak: for during the time of the late unhappy Rebellion, what could he do? how could he ſuffer more than he did? at his own charge (as far as he was able) raiſing both Men and Horſe for the King, engaging his five Sons (all that he had) in that just quarrel; expoſing all his Eſtate to rapine and plunder, his Children to diſtreſs and danger, and himſelf to many grievous ſhifts and exigencies: hunted up and down by his and the Kings enemies <hi>as a Patridge upon the mountains,</hi> foret to fly and hide himſelf in by-places and corners of the Country: And at laſt at that great Age to croſs the Seas for the ſafety of his life.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:49231:167"/>
            <p>And all this he did only that he might keep a good Conſcience, not out of any baſe or greedy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of Reward: For after his Majeſties return, when he might eaſily have obtained what he would have askt, he contented himſelf only with what his Majeſty was pleas'd freely to beſtow upon him; but had not his own modesty ſtood in the way, 'tis well known his Majeſties bounty towards him had not reſted here, but he muſt have died a Biſhop.</p>
            <p>Come we now from the Court into the Country, where we ſhall find him as much in the affections of the People as in favour with his Prince: Reſpected by the Nobility and Gentry, honoured by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty, reverenc'd by the Clergy, and generally beloved of all. And good reaſon there was, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his excellent good, ſweet, and obliging nature and diſpoſition, which drew to him the affections of all that had the happineſs to converſe with him, his free hearty entertainments and conſtant bounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hoſpitallity challeng'd a reſpect from all: <hi>Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per aliquis in Cydonis domo,</hi> may truly be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to him; for his houſe was <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> a houſe of Bread, where the rich were ſure to find divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the poor relief.</p>
            <p>Yet was he as far from a waſtful prodigality, as from a baſe penuriouſneſs. His Bounty was allay'd with that <hi>Vetus parſimonia,</hi> ſo much heretofore eſteemed, and ſtill exerciſed by all wiſe and ſober perſons: After he had taken enough for himſelf, his Friends, and his poor Neighbours, he carefully laid up the remainder, wherewith he hath made a competent proviſion for his Family: which being ſo honeſtly gotten, and ſo honourably ſaved, will doubtleſs carry Gods bleſſing along with it as it had his.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:49231:167"/>
            <p>Nor was his Religion towards God leſs than his Loyalty to his Prince, or his Charity to his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; it lay not ſo much in the tongue as in the heart. He manifested his Faith the ſureſt way, by his Works. He was no <hi>Phariſaical</hi> Chriſtian; he did not blow a Trumpet when he gave Alms; not tell the People by his looks when he faſted, nor call for a witneſs when he prayed. He had got ſuch an art in Giving, that one hand know not what the other gave. He had a way to conceal his Faſts, by the chearfulneſs of his Countenance, and he cared for no other eye to behold his Devotions but Gods and his holy Angels.</p>
            <p>And as he had God for his Father, ſo he had the Church for his Mother, which, next to God, he still reſpected and reverenced, ſympathizing with her in what condition ſoever ſhe was in. If ſhe wept, then did his eyes guſh out with water; if ſhe rejoyced, then was his mouth filled with laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and his tongue with joy. How have I ſeen him droop at the news of Gods <hi>Ark</hi> being in danger to be ſhaken? and how would his ſpirits revive again at any good tidings of its peace and ſettlement? how did he hate all thoſe that <hi>had evil will at Zion!</hi> yea he hated them as <hi>David</hi> did with a <hi>perfect hatred.</hi> And how did he delight in all ſuch as did ſeek the <hi>peace</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem!</hi> In a word, they that were friends to the Church were his friends; and he had no enemies but her Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries.</p>
            <p>As to his dealings amongſt men, they were all ſquare, and above-board. He was a perfect lover of Juſtice, and hated falſhood more than death. His love where he profeſt it, was without diſſimulation:
<pb facs="tcp:49231:168"/> He was a true <hi>Nathaniel, in whom there was no guile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And have you heard of the patience of <hi>Job?</hi> why ſuch was his: I can compare it to no other: As they were both upright men, and ſuch as <hi>feared God and eſchewed evil;</hi> ſo was God pleaſed to afflict them much alike. <hi>Job</hi> was caſt out of his own houſe, and ſo was he: <hi>Job</hi> was plunder'd of his Cattel by the <hi>Sabeans,</hi> and ſo was he of all that he had, by worſe than the <hi>Sabeans,</hi> if poſſible, by the rebellious <hi>Sequeſtratours: Job</hi> loſt his Children, ſo did he; only in this his miſery was not ſo great, <hi>Jobs</hi> Children were taken away rioting in a Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetting-houſe, but his died honourably in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of their Prince: <hi>Job</hi> was afflicted in his Wife too, and ſo was he; but in a quite contrary manner, <hi>Job</hi> in having the worſt of Wives, He in loſing the beſt: But the manner of his loſing her could not but add much to his ſorrow; for ſhe was ſnatcht out of the world in a tempeſt, and ſwallowed up quick by the mercileſs waves, having all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the treaſure he had about her, to a very conſiderable value; and a far greater treaſure in her arms then that, even his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, his young and darling Daughter, who choſe rather to embrace Death, than leave the embraces of her tender Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and ſo both ſunk together, with a Maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant that attended her, into the depth of the Sea. There are ſome, as I think at this time preſent, who were then with her, who remain the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Gods mercy in their deliverance, and faithful Witneſſes of the truth of what I ſpeak. Whoſe Courage, whoſe Conſtancy but <hi>Jobs</hi> or His, would not have ſtagger'd at ſuch a ſhock? whiles
<pb facs="tcp:49231:168"/> he like <hi>Job</hi> (having the Anchor of his Hope both ſure and ſtedfaſt) ſtood like the Center unmoved: And in the midſt of all theſe Croſſes and ſad events that befel him, he lookt upon the Divine hand invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſtriking with thoſe ſenſible ſcourges, againſt which he durſt not either Rebel or Murmur. All thoſe extremities did but exerciſe his Faith, not weaken it, which like a well wrought Vault, grew the ſtronger for the many preſſures which were laid upon him. <hi>In all this he did not ſin againſt God</hi> by his Impatience, <hi>nor charge God fooliſhly,</hi> but (with holy <hi>Job</hi>) reſigned himſelf wholly up to Gods will, ſaying with him, <hi>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away, bleſſed be the Name of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor were they more unlike in their Deaths, than in their Lives. <hi>The Lord bleſſed the latter end of them both, more then their beginning. Job</hi> died being Old and full of daies, and ſo did he; ſo full of Daies that he was ſatisfied, if not weary with long life, <hi>deſiring rather to be diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt.</hi> And ſo he died with <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> at the mouth of the Lord: God gently drew out the breath which he had breathed into him; quietly impinn'd his Tabernacle, and ſo took him to himſelf in peace.</p>
            <p>And now I find my ſelf like to that bad Orator, who could not <hi>deſinere,</hi> knew not how to make an end; which I cannot but be the more unwilling to do, becauſe I know that as ſoon as I have finiſht my diſcourſe, he will be carried from us, into the ſilent retirement of the Grave, and will be no more ſeen. And methinks 'tis ſome comfort to enjoy him even thus: But we muſt part. The Grave
<pb facs="tcp:49231:169"/> beckens him, and methinks I ſee him beckning us to follow him. <hi>O my Father, my Father</hi>—! Nature would ſpeak more, but Religion commands me ſilence. Could our Prayers have prevented his death, we ſhould have ſighed out our Souls to God to have begg'd his life; and could our tears yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore him, I ſee by thoſe watery planets in your eyes, we could command a deluge, like to that in the floor of <hi>Atan,</hi> or that of <hi>Hadadrimmon</hi> in the Valley of <hi>Megiddo.</hi> But he cannot come to us, and that's his <hi>happineſs;</hi> but we ſhall go to him, and that's our <hi>comfort. Let us not mourn for him therefore as men without hope.</hi> 'Tis but his Body that is dead, his Soul is ſtill alive, as well as ours; but far more happy: being already free of the glorious Company of Saints and Angels. And we ſhall meet again (I truſt in Glory) both our Souls and our Bodies; where all <hi>ſorrow</hi> ſhall be wiped from our eyes; where there ſhall be no more <hi>fear,</hi> nor <hi>death,</hi> nor <hi>ſin;</hi> but we ſhall be all as the Angels of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And ſo Lord thy Kingdom come; ſo come O Lord Jeſus, come quickly:</hi> In the hour of Death, and in the day of Judgment, good Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us. <hi>Give us grace ſo to live in thy fear, that we may die in thy favour, that ſo after this mortal life ended, we may be received by thee into thoſe heavenly habitations, where (we truſt) the Soul of our</hi> Dear Father <hi>here departed, together with the Souls of all them that ſleep in the</hi> Lord JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S, <hi>enjoy perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al reſt and felicity. Unto which, GOD of his infinite mercy bring us all for</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>his ſake.</hi> Amen.</p>
